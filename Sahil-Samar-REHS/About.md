# Hey, I'm Sahil. Welcome to my page!

## During my time in REHS, I:

### Developed a generic Knowledge Graph that can have useful applications in any relational based classroom type setting. I also developed a jupyter notebook to query as well as perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. This notebook is [linked here](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-students/REHS2022/blob/main/Sahil-Samar-REHS/Query-CS-Students.ipynb).

### I found a useful way to be able to host Neo4J databases on the cloud using the AuraDB service, and how to transfer over a local database to the cloud. Further, I found out how to authenticate connection to the database from a jupyter notebook that can be run locally or on a supercomputer like expanse. This means that the database is always hosted on the cloud, and can be queried or have CRUD performed on it at any time!

### Became familiar with Expanse and its Unix interface. Ran jobs, aliased commands, and learned SSH agent forwarding.

### Became familiar with TACC systems, namely Stampede and Jetstream. Figured out how to launch an instance on Jetstream and use its GUI to do things like launch a jupyter notebook on the local web. 

### Learned how to use TAPIS with Stampede, meaning that I was able to authenticate to TAPIS and run jobs on Stampede via a local Jupyter Notebook.

### Created some instructional material on Neo4J and TAPIS. It's [linked here](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-students/REHS2022/tree/main/InstructionalMaterial)
