# Neo4j Visualization
One of the key features of neo4j is visualization. This has traditionally been done through the neo4j browser or neo4jupyter. We have yet to replicate this functionality directly on a CLI application. Our goal here will be to create an effective, lightweight visualization tool to be used via CLI using matplotlib.
