# TapisCLI
The tapis CLI is designed to provide a streamlined, accessible interface for Stampede at TACC through Tapis. The client focuses on putting pods, systems, file management, and apps all in the same place to make managing resources easier for the user. 

In order to cut down on operational delays, the program will be organized as a localhost server and client, so that imports only have to happen once every so often.

## THE LOCALHOST SERVER NOW WORKS.
running the client should automatically start the server regardless of OS. STill have not tested this functionality with unix operating systemns. Only confirmed to work on windows. 

will test actual command function later

the help menu needs a major update, after integration of argparse commands.
